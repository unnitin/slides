# A Differentiated GTM Model Captures 3× More Revenue Than the Current Undifferentiated Approach

## Go-to-Market Strategy
### Capturing $1.8B in Addressable Revenue Across Three Segments

@notes: The core problem: the current GTM treats all segments with the same motion, resulting in a high-cost model that underperforms in each segment individually.

---

# Current GTM model underperforms across all three revenue segments
@type: stat_callout

@stat: 23% | Win Rate in Enterprise Segment | vs. 41% benchmark for category leaders
@stat: $2.1M | Average Cost Per Enterprise Logo | 2.4× best-practice benchmark of $875K
@stat: 68% | Mid-Market Churn at 12 Months | Driven by poor fit and inadequate onboarding

@exhibit: Exhibit 1 — GTM Performance Diagnostics
@source: BCG Sales Excellence Benchmark, N=340 B2B companies, 2024

@notes: The mid-market churn number is the most urgent issue — it represents $180M in ARR being destroyed annually by a broken GTM motion.

# Three distinct segments require fundamentally different GTM approaches
@type: comparison

@compare:
  header: Segment | ACV Range | Right Motion | Sales Cycle | Investment Level
  row: Enterprise (>$500K ACV) | $500K–$5M | Strategic accounts, dedicated pods, multi-year | 9–18 months | High
  row: Commercial ($50K–$500K ACV) | $50K–$500K | Territory model, inside sales + SE pairs | 3–6 months | Medium
  row: SMB (<$50K ACV) | $5K–$50K | Product-led growth, self-serve, digital-first | Days–weeks | Low (automated)

@exhibit: Exhibit 2 — Segment GTM Model Design

@notes: The enterprise motion is the highest-value lever. Fixing win rates from 23% to 38% in enterprise alone generates $320M in incremental ARR.

# Enterprise GTM redesign focuses on three high-impact structural changes
@type: two_column

@col:
  ## Sales Model (Structure)
  - Replace territory model with named account pods (1 AE + 1 SE + 1 CSM)
  - Executive sponsor program: C-suite to C-suite relationships
  - Account-based marketing aligned to top 200 named accounts
  - Mutual success plan as standard deal structure

@col:
  ## Enablement (Execution Quality)
  - Value engineering capability in every enterprise deal
  - Competitive battle cards updated quarterly
  - Demo environment standardization (eliminate demo debt)
  - Deal review cadence: weekly pipeline review, bi-weekly executive QBR

@notes: The named account pod model is the single highest-ROI change. It aligns incentives and eliminates the handoff failures that drive enterprise churn.

# GTM transformation delivers full impact in 24 months through phased rollout
@type: timeline

@step: Months 1–4 | Segment Redesign | Define segment boundaries, restructure territories, align compensation
@step: Months 4–9 | Enterprise Motion | Named account pods, ABM launch, value engineering training
@step: Months 9–16 | Commercial Excellence | Inside sales tooling, SE pairing model, deal desk
@step: Months 16–24 | PLG Infrastructure | Self-serve onboarding, usage analytics, automated expansion triggers

@source: BCG GTM Transformation Methodology, 2024

@notes: Compensation redesign in Month 1 is critical — the field will not change behavior until incentives change. Do this before anything else.

---

# GTM transformation requires four decisions in the next 30 days
@type: next_steps

@action: Define enterprise named account list (top 200) and assign initial pods | CRO + BCG | Week 1–2
@action: Redesign sales compensation to reward multi-year ACV and NRR | CFO + CRO | Week 2–4
@action: Identify and pilot PLG motion with 3 SMB sub-segments | CPO + Marketing | Month 2
@action: Launch account-based marketing for top 50 enterprise targets | CMO | Month 2–3

@notes: Compensation is the linchpin. Every subsequent action depends on the field believing the new model will be rewarded. Move fast on this one.

## One GTM motion for three different buyers is not a strategy — it is an excuse for underperformance
