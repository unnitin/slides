# The business case is stronger than most organizations realize
@type: stat_callout

@stat: 35% | Average Infrastructure Cost Reduction | Vs. on-premise equivalents at scale
@stat: 2.4× | Developer Productivity Gain | For teams on modern cloud-native stack
@stat: 60% | Faster Time-to-Market | For new digital products post-migration

@exhibit: Exhibit 1 — Cloud Value Metrics
@source: McKinsey Cloud Value Study, N=700 enterprise migrations, 2023; Gartner Infrastructure Benchmark, 2024

@notes: The developer productivity number is often the most surprising to CFOs. Frame it as talent leverage — you get more output from the same headcount.

# Three migration pathways offer different risk-return profiles
@type: comparison

@compare:
  header: Pathway | Timeline | Cost | Risk | Value Realization
  row: Lift & Shift | 12–18 months | Low | Low | 25% of potential — cost savings only
  row: Re-platform | 18–30 months | Medium | Medium | 60% of potential — efficiency + flexibility
  row: Re-architect | 24–48 months | High | High | 100% of potential — full competitive platform

@exhibit: Exhibit 2 — Migration Strategy Options
@source: McKinsey Cloud Migration Benchmark, 2024

@notes: Most clients default to lift-and-shift out of risk aversion. Replatforming is typically the correct risk-adjusted choice for the core application portfolio.

# A phased wave approach minimizes disruption while capturing value early
@type: two_column

@col:
  ## Wave 1: Quick Wins (Months 1–9)
  - Dev/test environments and non-critical workloads
  - Collaboration and productivity SaaS migration
  - Data warehouse modernization (cloud-native DWH)
  - Estimated savings: $12M annually

@col:
  ## Wave 2: Core Platform (Months 10–24)
  - Customer-facing applications and APIs
  - Core transaction processing systems
  - Analytics and ML infrastructure
  - Estimated savings: $45M annually + new capability

@notes: Wave 1 builds organizational capability and confidence. It is not just cost savings — it is learning infrastructure for Wave 2.

# Cloud migration delivers value across five dimensions simultaneously
@type: bullet_points
@layout: icon_rows

- @icon: database | Infrastructure cost reduction of 30–40% through elasticity and right-sizing
- @icon: rocket   | 60% faster release cycles enabling competitive product velocity
- @icon: shield   | Enhanced security posture with automated compliance and threat detection
- @icon: brain    | Scalable ML and analytics platform enabling data-driven operations
- @icon: chart    | Real-time visibility into cost allocation and optimization opportunities

@notes: Emphasize that these five are mutually reinforcing — faster releases + better data + lower costs compound over time.
