# Without MLOps Infrastructure, 87% of Models Never Reach Production — Here Is the Build Sequence
@type: title

## MLOps Platform Build
### From Model Experiments to Production-Grade AI Infrastructure

@notes: The engineering teams are building models — that is not the problem. The problem is that 87% of models that clear technical review never reach production because there is no deployment infrastructure.

# The production gap is costing the organization $140M in unrealized AI value
@type: stat_callout

@stat: 87% | Models That Never Reach Production | vs. 40% at MLOps-mature organizations
@stat: 14 weeks | Average Time to Deploy a Production Model | Best practice: 2–3 days with CI/CD
@stat: $140M | Unrealized AI Value | From models built but not deployed in past 24 months

@exhibit: Exhibit 1 — MLOps Maturity Diagnostic
@source: BCG Gamma AI Engineering Benchmark; company engineering data, 2024

@notes: The 14-week deployment time is the most powerful engineering argument. It is not a skill gap — it is a process and infrastructure gap. MLOps fixes infrastructure; it does not fix skills.

# MLOps platform covers five capability layers from data to serving
@type: comparison

@compare:
  header: Layer | Capability | Recommended Tool | Current State
  row: Data and features | Feature store, data versioning | Feast + Delta Lake | Absent — each team manages own
  row: Experiment tracking | Model versioning, parameter tracking | MLflow | Ad hoc (notebooks, Google Drive)
  row: Training orchestration | Distributed training, hyperparameter tuning | Kubeflow Pipelines | Manual scripts
  row: Model registry and governance | Model catalog, approval workflow, audit | MLflow Registry | Absent
  row: Serving and monitoring | Real-time serving, drift detection, alerting | Seldon + Evidently | Manual + fragile

@exhibit: Exhibit 2 — MLOps Platform Component Design
@source: BCG Gamma AI Platform Reference Architecture, 2024

@notes: Do not try to build all five layers simultaneously. Start with experiment tracking (MLflow) — it is the highest-value, lowest-complexity layer and delivers immediate productivity gains.

# MLOps build sequence prioritizes developer productivity before deployment scale
@type: timeline

@step: Month 1–2 | Experiment Tracking | MLflow deployment, team migration, standardized model metadata
@step: Month 3–5 | Feature Store | Feast implementation, 3 core feature domains, backfill pipeline
@step: Month 5–8 | Training Pipelines | Kubeflow for model training orchestration, GPU cluster setup
@step: Month 9–12 | Model Registry | Governance workflow, staging/production promotion, audit trail
@step: Month 12–18 | Serving and Monitoring | Production serving infrastructure, drift detection, alerting

@source: BCG Gamma AI Platform Build Methodology, 2024

@notes: Month 12 is when the compounding begins. Once the registry and serving infrastructure are in place, every subsequent model deploy is days, not weeks.

## MLOps is not infrastructure overhead — it is the multiplier that makes every AI investment return
