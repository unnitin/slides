# Three Structural Changes Will Double NRR and Unlock the Path to $200M ARR
@type: title

## SaaS Growth Architecture
### Scaling from $50M to $200M ARR

@notes: The $200M ARR target is achievable in 36 months if the company fixes net revenue retention first — that is the crux of this engagement.

# Current unit economics reveal a leaky bucket that limits scalable growth
@type: stat_callout

@stat: 104% | Current Net Revenue Retention | Strong but below top-quartile benchmark of 120%+
@stat: 18 months | Average Payback Period | Best-in-class SaaS targets sub-12 months
@stat: 67% | Gross Revenue Retention | 8-point gap to top-quartile peer median of 75%

@exhibit: Exhibit 1 — Unit Economics Benchmarks vs. Peers
@source: Bain SaaS Benchmarking Database, N=240 B2B SaaS companies $25M–$500M ARR, 2024

@notes: The GRR gap is the most actionable number. Eight points of retention improvement translates directly to $12M+ of additional ARR by Year 3.

# Four levers explain the NRR gap vs. top-quartile peers
@type: comparison

@compare:
  header: Lever | Current State | Top-Quartile Benchmark | Gap
  row: Onboarding time-to-value | 45 days | 14 days | −31 days
  row: Expansion revenue motion | Ad hoc, rep-driven | Systematic product-led | Structural
  row: Customer health scoring | Reactive (CSM judgment) | Predictive (ML model) | Capability
  row: QBR coverage (>$50K ACV) | 40% of accounts | 100% of accounts | 60ppt

@exhibit: Exhibit 2 — NRR Gap Analysis
@source: Bain SaaS Growth Benchmarking, 2024

@notes: Onboarding is the fastest lever to pull. 31-day reduction in TTV is achievable in 90 days with focused product investment.

# The path to $200M ARR requires three parallel workstreams
@type: two_column

@col:
  ## Retention Engine (Months 1–12)
  - Rebuild onboarding: guided setup, in-app milestones
  - Launch predictive churn model (ML on product usage)
  - Expand QBR coverage to 100% of accounts >$50K ACV
  - Target: GRR 75%, NRR 120%

@col:
  ## Expansion Engine (Months 6–18)
  - Product-led expansion: usage-based upsell triggers
  - Land-and-expand playbook for enterprise segment
  - Pricing repackage: usage tiers + add-on modules
  - Target: Expansion ARR contributes 35% of net new ARR

@notes: Both workstreams must run in parallel. Retention without expansion is survival; expansion without retention is a treadmill.

# Growth to $200M ARR follows a deterministic 36-month trajectory
@type: timeline

@step: Q1–Q2 2025 | Retention Foundation | Onboarding rebuild, churn model, QBR coverage
@step: Q3–Q4 2025 | Expansion Launch | PLG triggers, land-and-expand playbook, pricing repackage
@step: Q1–Q2 2026 | Channel Scale | Partner ecosystem, reseller program, geographic expansion
@step: Q3–Q4 2026 | $100M ARR Milestone | NRR >120%, payback <12 months, Series C positioning
@step: 2027 | $200M ARR Target | Full enterprise motion, international presence, IPO readiness

@notes: The $100M ARR milestone in late 2026 is the critical proof point for institutional investors and potential acquirers.

---

# The next 90 days establish whether this trajectory is achievable
@type: next_steps

@action: Redesign onboarding flow with time-to-value <14 days | CPO + Bain | Month 1–2
@action: Build and deploy predictive churn scoring model | Data Science | Month 2–3
@action: Implement QBR program for all accounts >$50K ACV | VP CS | Month 1
@action: Design usage-based pricing tiers and test with 50 accounts | CFO + CPO | Month 2–3

@notes: The onboarding redesign and QBR expansion are the two highest-ROI actions. They require minimal technology investment but significant process change.
