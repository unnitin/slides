# B2B Companies That Adopt Algorithmic Pricing Capture 200–500 Basis Points More Margin

## B2B Pricing Transformation
### From Gut-Feel to Algorithmic Precision

@notes: The consulting diagnosis: pricing in this organization is effectively a tribal knowledge system. Senior reps carry the intelligence in their heads. This creates fragility, inconsistency, and leakage.

# Pricing capability gap is structural — and the financial cost is measurable
@type: stat_callout

@stat: 3.8ppt | EBITDA Improvement | From algorithmic pricing vs. rep-judgment baseline (Bain benchmark)
@stat: 47% | Price Variance for Equivalent Transactions | Within the same customer segment
@stat: $0 | Formal Pricing Team Investment | Currently — no dedicated pricing function exists

@exhibit: Exhibit 1 — Pricing Capability Assessment
@source: Bain B2B Pricing Benchmark, N=180 industrial and software B2B companies, 2024

@notes: The 47% within-segment variance is the most powerful diagnostic. It proves definitively that pricing is not intentional — it is noise. Algorithmic pricing eliminates noise.

# Algorithmic pricing works through three interconnected capabilities
@type: two_column

@col:
  ## Data Foundation
  - Transaction-level margin data linked to customer attributes
  - Competitive price index built from win/loss data
  - Product cost model at SKU or service level
  - Customer profitability scoring across full relationship

@col:
  ## Pricing Intelligence Engine
  - ML model predicting deal-level willingness-to-pay
  - Real-time guidance in CRM: floor, target, and ceiling prices
  - Automated approval routing for exception requests
  - Pricing outcome tracking: did the recommendation win?

@notes: The data foundation is the hardest part. Most B2B companies have the data but it is fragmented across ERP, CRM, and spreadsheets. Data unification is a 3–6 month effort before the ML model can be built.

# Phased rollout minimizes disruption while building organizational pricing muscle
@type: timeline

@step: Months 1–4 | Data Foundation | Unify transaction, cost, and CRM data; build win/loss database
@step: Months 5–9 | Model Development | Train WTP model, test in pilot segment (20% of revenue)
@step: Months 10–15 | Guided Selling | Deploy real-time pricing guidance in CRM for all reps
@step: Months 16–24 | Full Automation | Automated quote-to-price for standard configurations; escalation-only for exceptions

@source: Bain B2B Pricing Transformation Methodology, 2024

@notes: The pilot in Months 5–9 is critical for organizational buy-in. Rep skepticism is real — the pilot produces data that wins the field's confidence before full rollout.
