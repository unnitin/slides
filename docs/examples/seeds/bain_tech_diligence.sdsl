# CloudOps Is a Differentiated Asset With a Defensible Moat — Recommend Proceed at $420M
@type: title

## Technology Due Diligence: CloudOps Platform
### PE Investment Assessment

@notes: Diligence finding: recommend proceed. The thesis is defensible but the integration roadmap must be front-loaded in the 100-day plan.

# Key diligence metrics support the investment thesis at current valuation
@type: stat_callout

@stat: 118% | Net Revenue Retention | Top-decile for infrastructure software category
@stat: 4.2× | ARR Growth (3-Year CAGR) | Driven by enterprise land-and-expand motion
@stat: 71% | Gross Margin | 6ppt expansion YoY; path to 75%+ visible in 18 months

@exhibit: Exhibit 1 — CloudOps Financial Summary
@source: Company financials, Bain analysis; comparable from Bessemer Cloud Index, 2024

@notes: The 118% NRR is the most important number in the diligence. It means the existing customer base grows itself — reducing dependence on new logo acquisition.

# Technology architecture is a strength with one significant risk area
@type: comparison

@compare:
  header: Dimension | Assessment | Confidence | Key Finding
  row: Core product architecture | Best-in-class microservices | High | Scalable to 10× current load
  row: Security posture | SOC2 Type II, GDPR compliant | High | No material gaps
  row: Engineering team quality | Top-quartile retention, strong IC culture | High | Retention risk post-close
  row: Technical debt | 18% of sprint capacity on maintenance | Medium | Elevated but manageable
  row: Data infrastructure | Legacy ETL, pre-cloud architecture | Low | Requires $3–5M remediation

@exhibit: Exhibit 2 — Technology Assessment Summary
@source: Bain technical diligence, code review, 14 engineering interviews, 2024

@notes: The data infrastructure issue is the material risk. Budget $4M in the investment thesis and make modernization a Year 1 priority.

# Two value creation levers account for 70% of the equity return model
@type: two_column

@col:
  ## Lever 1: Enterprise Expansion (60% of value)
  - Current enterprise segment is underpenetrated: only 340 of 2,000 TAM accounts
  - Land-and-expand model proven: average account grows 3.2× over 24 months
  - Enterprise sales capacity is the constraint — need 12 additional AEs in Year 1
  - Target: Enterprise ARR from 45% → 65% of total by Year 3

@col:
  ## Lever 2: International Expansion (30% of value)
  - Product is market-ready for EMEA; no localization required
  - EMEA TAM estimated at $1.2B, currently 0% penetrated by CloudOps
  - Partner-led GTM is the fastest path to EMEA scale
  - Target: EMEA ARR = 20% of total by Year 3

@notes: International expansion is a Year 2 priority — get the domestic enterprise motion right first before adding geographic complexity.

# 100-Day Plan prioritizes retention and enterprise sales capacity
@type: next_steps

@action: Implement retention program for top 50 engineering talent with retention packages | CEO + PE Sponsor | Day 1–30
@action: Launch enterprise sales hiring: 12 AEs and 2 RVPs for Midwest and Southeast territories | CRO | Day 30–90
@action: Fund data infrastructure modernization ($4M capex) and assign dedicated team | CTO | Day 30
@action: Begin EMEA partner diligence: identify 3 anchor system integrators | BD Lead | Day 60–100

@notes: Engineering retention is day-one critical. If the three founding engineers leave in the first 6 months, it materially impairs the investment.
