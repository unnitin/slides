# A Modern Data Platform Generates 4× the Analytics Value at One-Third the Operational Cost

## Data Platform Strategy
### Building the Foundational Infrastructure for a Data-Driven Enterprise

@notes: The current state is 14 disconnected data systems, no unified data layer, and 40% of analyst time spent on data wrangling rather than insight generation. This is a platform architecture problem, not a talent problem.

# Current data infrastructure creates three compounding performance penalties
@type: stat_callout

@stat: 40% | Analyst Time on Data Wrangling | vs. 12% benchmark for mature data organizations
@stat: 14 | Disconnected Data Systems | Requiring manual reconciliation; no single source of truth
@stat: 11 days | Average Time From Question to Insight | Best-in-class: under 2 hours for standard queries

@exhibit: Exhibit 1 — Data Infrastructure Maturity Assessment
@source: McKinsey Data Maturity Benchmark, N=420 enterprises across industries, 2024

@notes: The 11-day time-to-insight is the most compelling number for business stakeholders. Frame the platform investment in terms of decision velocity, not infrastructure cost.

# Modern data platform architecture unifies storage, processing, and governance
@type: two_column

@col:
  ## Medallion Architecture (Recommended)
  - Bronze layer: raw ingestion from all source systems
  - Silver layer: cleaned, validated, conformed data
  - Gold layer: business-ready datasets and aggregations
  - Separation of storage (object store) from compute
  - Enables: streaming and batch on same data infrastructure

@col:
  ## Governance and Access
  - Unified data catalog with business-friendly metadata
  - Column-level access controls with role-based permissions
  - Data lineage tracking from source to dashboard
  - Automated data quality monitoring with alerting
  - Self-serve access for analysts without engineering tickets

@notes: The medallion architecture is the right choice for this organization's scale. It provides the clean separation needed for governance without sacrificing flexibility.

# Platform build follows a 24-month sequence from foundation to self-serve
@type: timeline

@step: Months 1–6 | Foundation | Cloud infrastructure, bronze/silver ingestion, core 5 data domains
@step: Months 7–12 | Analytics Layer | Gold models, semantic layer, BI tool standardization
@step: Months 13–18 | Self-Serve | Data catalog, governed self-serve access, analyst workspace
@step: Months 19–24 | AI-Ready | Feature store, ML infrastructure, real-time streaming layer

@source: McKinsey Data Platform Implementation Methodology, 2024

@notes: Months 1–6 are the critical investment period. The platform will not produce visible business value until Month 8–10. Managing executive patience through this period requires clear milestone communication.
